# ButtonClicksLogger
Simple app that stores button clicks and display them. When the show details button is clicked,
a new string that contains an int id and the timestamp is created and stored inside a string array.
This string array is then displayed on the screen. Use ngClass to conditionally apply "colored-btn-click" to only items
whose indexes are 5 are highered(index is 1-based)

# What I learnt:
ngFor to loop through item list. ngIf to conditionally render items. ngClass to conditionally apply styles.
